# Browser Automation JS

This package allows you to programmatically communicate with browsers using WebSockets - e.g., automatically navigate to a webpage and click a button. WebDriver BiDi is used for Firefox, Chrome DevTools Protocol for Chromium.

The purpose of this package is to allow browser automation for all browser verisons that support CDP or WebDriver BiDi. This is primarily useful to compare browser features adoption or vulnerabilities exploits across different browser versions. If you want to test your website in the latest browsers, you will be much better off with frameworks such as [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) etc.
